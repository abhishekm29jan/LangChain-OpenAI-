# 🤖 LangChain (Open AI)

Welcome to the **LangChain Playground**! 🎯
This repository showcases powerful AI workflows built using **[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)** — a framework designed to create intelligent LLM-based applications such as chatbots, agents, document Q\&A systems, and more.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

Explore the building blocks of LLM-powered apps through:

* 🔗 **Chains** – Combine prompts and models for custom workflows
* 🎯 **Agents** – Let LLMs decide which tools to use dynamically
* 🧠 **Memory** – Store and recall past conversations for context
* 📄 **Document Loaders & Embeddings** – Work with your own data
* 🔍 **Vector Stores** – Perform semantic search (e.g. FAISS, Chroma)
* 🧰 **Tool Integrations** – Call APIs, calculators, or custom tools
* 💬 (Optional) **UI with Streamlit/Gradio** – Test everything visually
