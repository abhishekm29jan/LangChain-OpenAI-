## 🌟 LangChain + OpenAI Project
This repository contains code examples and scripts demonstrating how to use LangChain with OpenAI's API to build intelligent language model applications 🤖.

📌 Overview
This project showcases a basic LangChain integration with OpenAI's GPT models using Python 🐍.
The example demonstrates how to initialize a LangChain OpenAI language model object and send prompts to generate AI-powered responses ✨.

🚀 Features
⚡ Easy setup & usage of LangChain with OpenAI in Python.

🔒 Secure API key management using environment variables & .env files.

💬 Example of sending prompts to the model and printing its responses.

🛠️ Works smoothly in VS Code for development & testing.
